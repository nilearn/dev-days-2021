[Nilearn](https://nilearn.github.io) enables approachable and versatile analyses of brain volumes.
It provides statistical and machine-learning tools, with instructive documentation & friendly community.

[Nibabel](https://nipy.org/nibabel/) provides read and write access to some common medical and neuroimaging file formats.

In the 2021 Dev Days, we hope to onboard new contributors to our community and explore future directions for development.

## Schedule

Although we encourage hacking throughout the Dev Days, we wanted to include a few structured events during a smaller portion 
of the day when both our European and American contributors are likely to be awake.

We also especially encourage attendees to suggest additional events during these times !
