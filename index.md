[Nilearn](https://nilearn.github.io) enables approachable and versatile analyses of brain volumes.
It provides statistical and machine-learning tools, with instructive documentation & friendly community.

[Nibabel](https://nipy.org/nibabel/) provides read and write access to some common medical and neuroimaging file formats.

In the 2021 Dev Days, we hope to onboard new contributors to our communities and explore future directions for development.

To create more dynamic time together (albeit remotely), we have created a [Nilearn-Nibabel-Dev-Days Discord](https://discord.gg/bMBhb7w) server.
We will be holding all community discussions there, so we encourage you to join and introduce yourself on the platform !

If you need help getting started with Discord or with navigating the Nilearn and Nibabel code bases,
check out our [getting started guide](https://nilearn.github.io/dev-days-2021/getting-started.html).

## Event schedule

Although we encourage hacking throughout the Dev Days, we wanted to include a few structured events during a smaller portion
of the day when both our European and American contributors are likely to be awake.

We also especially encourage attendees to suggest additional events during these times !
