## Ready to get started ?

In this section we explain briefly how to get up and running in a minimal number of steps.

### Install Python

The firts step is obviously to have Python installed and working. We recommand having a version of Python higher or equal to 3.6. If you don't have Python installed already, you can get it on the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Install Nilearn

Once you have Python installed correclty on your machine, you need to install [Nilearn](https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn) and its dependencies. Nilearn is available through [Pypi](https://pypi.org/project/nilearn/) such that you should be able to run:

```bash
$ pip install nilearn
```

Note that you may want to create a virtual environnement using for example [anaconda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html). More information for installing nilearn is available on the [online documentation](https://nilearn.github.io/introduction.html#installation).

### Checkout Nilearn contributing docs

Once you have Python and Nilearn installed and working, you can checkout the nilearn [contributing documentation](http://nilearn.github.io/development.html) which explains how to get set up to make contributions to the project.

### Browse selected issues

Finally, when you are ready to contribute, you can browse the issues we have selected specifically for the sprint on the following [project board](https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/projects/6).

## Sprint infrastructure

- Technical discussions should take place on GitHub as usual to keep track of development and have open discussions.
- To create more dynamic time together (albeit remotely), we have created a [Nilearn-Dev-Days Discord](https://discord.gg/bMBhb7w) room.
  You can find a quick introduction to the Discord platform at the end of this email.
- Important announcements will be made on both Discord “general” channel and the dedicated Nilearn issue.

## Daily organization

- To say hello and organize work, we will have two introductory meetings on Wednesday at 9:30a CET and 9:30a EDT.
  To share progress we will have another common session on Thursday 5:00p CET, 11a EDT.
- You can find all relevant events in [the sprint calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/b/3?cid=bmlsZWFybi5ldmVudHNAZ21haWwuY29t).
- We welcome all contributors to schedule discussions for specific topics of interest.
  These sessions should be announced with at least a few hours notice on both the GitHub issue and Discord room.
- We will consider the sprint hours to run roughly from 9:00a CET to 6:00p EDT.
  We do not expect anyone to attend all (or most !) of that time !
  These are just the times when at least one current Nilearn core developer will be online to help with general questions and point towards available resources.

### An introduction to Discord

Discord is a chat platform that allows for both voice and text communication.
In the left panel, you can modify settings at the top (notifications, privacy…) and see all available channels below (text and voice)
In the right panel you can see who is connected and contact them directly.

The general channels will be for welcoming, general announcements, and asking general questions.
A break channel is dedicated to sharing breaks together.
You can create other channels to accommodate specific needs (for example, setting up your development environment).
Notifications can be a bit overwhelming on Discord, don’t hesitate to filter them out while working (muting channels with right-click or setting your account on Do Not Disturb).
